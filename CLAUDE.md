# CLAUDE.md — claude-skills

## Project Purpose

Portable AI agent skill distribution repo. Skills are framework-agnostic instruction sets that extend agent capabilities for specialized tasks.

## Repository Structure

```
skills/          ← Source directories (edit here)
dist/            ← Packaged .skill ZIP files (auto-generated)
hooks/pre-commit ← Auto-packages modified skills into dist/ on commit
scripts/         ← audit_skills.py (lint), install-skills.sh (symlink installer)
tests/           ← pytest suites for audit + skill structure
.agent/          ← Agentic OS layer (state, learnings, evals) — see "Agentic OS" below
.claude/hooks/   ← PostToolUse hooks (auto-package on Edit/Write)
conductor/       ← Project planning docs (product.md, tech-stack.md, workflow.md)
```

## How Skills Work

Each skill is a self-contained directory under `skills/` with:

- **SKILL.md** (required) — YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `version`) + detailed markdown instructions
- **references/** — Deep technical docs, checklists, and lookup material
- **templates/** — Starter code files agents can copy into projects
- **examples/** — Reference implementations
- **scripts/** — Helper scripts (scanners, generators, etc.)

Skills are consumed by Claude (`~/.claude/skills/`) and Gemini (`~/.gemini/skills/`). See the Workflow section for the canonical symlink layout.

## Agent Best Practices

When operating within this repository, agents should adhere to the following directives:

1. **Validation:** Always run `python3 scripts/audit_skills.py skills` before committing changes to ensure new or modified skills comply with repository standards (e.g., kebab-case naming, `SKILL.md` presence, no forbidden loose files).
2. **Installation:** If you add a new skill or fix symlinks, run `./scripts/install-skills.sh` to ensure it is correctly mapped to `~/.agents/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, and `~/.gemini/skills/`.
3. **Versioning:** If you modify a skill's logic or documentation, increment its semver `version` in the `SKILL.md` frontmatter.
4. **No Direct `dist/` Edits:** Never attempt to modify the `.skill` ZIP archives in `dist/`. Edit the source in `skills/` and let the git hooks handle packaging.
5. **Agentic OS Startup:** Upon every invocation, before responding to the user's prompt, check if `.agent/state/tasks.json` has pending tasks. If so, automatically execute the `heartbeat` skill (via `python3 ~/.claude/skills/heartbeat/scripts/heartbeat.py pop`) to process the queue.
6. **Tests:** Run `python3 -m pytest tests/` after touching `scripts/audit_skills.py` or skill-structure conventions.
7. **Cross-agent rules:** Before starting work, also read `./GEMINI.md` for shared writing-style and technical-preference standards that apply to all agents (no em dashes, pnpm over npm, etc.).

## Workflow

1. Edit skill source in `skills/<name>/`
2. `dist/` is rebuilt automatically:
   - **On edit**: PostToolUse hook (`.claude/hooks/package-skill.sh`) rebuilds `dist/<name>.skill` on every Edit/Write
   - **On commit**: Pre-commit hook (`hooks/pre-commit`) packages any remaining staged changes
3. Install -- run the install script to symlink skill directories to all install locations:
   - `./scripts/install-skills.sh`
   This script creates the following symlinks:
   - `~/.agents/skills/<name>/` -> `skills/<name>/` (canonical, agent-agnostic)
   - `~/.claude/skills/<name>/` -> `~/.agents/skills/<name>/`
   - `~/.gemini/skills/<name>/` -> `~/.agents/skills/<name>/`
   (Note: Do not symlink directly to Gemini extensions like Antigravity as Gemini natively loads `~/.gemini/skills/` globally, which would cause duplicate install warnings.)
   - Or publish via `npx skills` ecosystem (see https://skills.sh/)

All install paths are symlinks. Editing any copy edits the upstream source.

## Conventions

- No build system -- this repo has no `package.json` or runtime dependencies
- Franchise placeholder: Star Wars (use for sample data, form labels, empty states)
- `.skill` files are standard ZIP archives renamed for clarity
- Always edit in `skills/`, never edit `dist/` directly

## Agentic OS

This repo runs an Agentic OS layer at `.agent/` for cross-session memory and task queueing. Key paths:

- `.agent/state/tasks.json` — shared task queue (pending / in_progress / completed / failed)
- `.agent/state/last-run.json` — most recent completed task summary
- `.agent/state/errors.json` — unresolved failures (consumed by `command-center`)
- `.agent/learnings/<skill>.json` — per-skill rule changes from past sessions
- `.agent/evals/<skill>.json` — per-skill "definition of done" criteria

Process the queue with the `heartbeat` skill:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/heartbeat/scripts/heartbeat.py pop      # claim next task
python3 ~/.claude/skills/heartbeat/scripts/heartbeat.py complete <task_id> --outcome '{"result":"…"}'
python3 ~/.claude/skills/heartbeat/scripts/heartbeat.py fail <task_id> --reason "…"
```

Before any specialized work, read the relevant `learnings/<skill>.json` and apply its `rule_change` entries. After finishing, append new learnings via `learn.py`.

## Versioning

Each SKILL.md frontmatter includes a `version` field using semver (`major.minor.patch`). When you modify a skill's SKILL.md or scripts, bump the version:

- **Patch** (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1): bug fixes, typo corrections, doc clarifications
- **Minor** (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0): new features, new commands, new sections
- **Major** (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0): breaking changes to script CLI, manifest format, or skill structure

## Bug Filing Protocol

When a skill script returns a JSON response with `"type": "UnhandledException"`, the agent must:

1. **Read the `fix` field** for an Agent Directive with specific instructions.
2. **Document the bug** by appending a row to the skill's `KNOWN_BUGS.md` file with: date, the command that was run, the error message, and status "open".
3. **Notify the user** that an internal bug was caught and logged.
4. **Check the `logFile` field** for the path to the full traceback on disk. Reference this path when documenting the bug.

Skills with scripts may have a `KNOWN_BUGS.md` at their root (`skills/<name>/KNOWN_BUGS.md`). Error logs are persisted to disk:
- OpenAI Image: `~/.omni_image/logs/error.log`
